## How to install (long version)

Just copy GitPad.exe to a folder and double-click on it. It will install
itself into your Application Data directory (%AppData%) - if your default
editor is not set, GitPad.exe will set itself to EDITOR via setting an
Environment Variable on your user profile.

## What do I need to use this?

GitPad requires .NET 2.0 or higher.
